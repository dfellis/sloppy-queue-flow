# sloppy-queue-flow [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dfellis/sloppy-queue-flow.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dfellis/sloppy-queue-flow)

## Quick install instructions

For Node.js

    npm install sloppy-queue-flow

Note: ``sloppy-queue-flow`` version ``0.1.10`` requires Node version ``0.8.17`` and NPM version ``1.2.0`` to take advantage of the new ``peerDependencies`` mechanism. This means that if you require a specific version of ``queue-flow`` in your application, ``sloppy-queue-flow`` will use that version rather than pulling in its own copy. It is otherwise identical to version ``0.1.9``.

For developers, ``npm test`` to check your changes (using [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit/)) haven't broken existing functionality. Literate programming documentation can be found inside of the ``/docs`` directory, generated by [docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/).

## Usage

For details on how it all works in general, see the [queue-flow](https://github.com/dfellis/queue-flow/) library for detailed API documentation and usage examples.

``sloppy-queue-flow`` is a replacement constructor function that eliminates guarantees on queue order to allow execution on each item in the queue to traverse through the flow as fast as possible. This is a trade-off that makes sense for things like the Express-like server example from the main queue-flow library, but would break the dependency resolution example. Essentially, ``sloppy-queue-flow`` is only valid for cases where all operations are [commutative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property), which is not everything, but does cover a surprising number of cases.

To use ``sloppy-queue-flow`` in Node.js, simply:

```js
var q = require('queue-flow');
var sloppy = require('sloppy-queue-flow');

q('sloppyQueue', sloppy) // Code here
```

## When should you use sloppy-queue-flow over the "regular" queue-flow?

### Are the items in the queue totally independent?

Such as HTTP request-response pairs that will be served to totally different users and have no impact on one another? Then ``sloppy-queue-flow`` will improve the performance of the system and push the bottlenecks out to your I/O.

### Can the items in the queue be processed in any order even if the outcome depends on all of them?

Such as ``4*3*2 == 2*3*4``? Then ``sloppy-queue-flow`` can be used, but you must be cautious. If at any time in the future you change it to something that *can't* be reordered, such as ``4/3/2 != 2/3/4``, then you need to drop usage of ``sloppy-queue-flow``.

### General Rule of Thumb

``queue-flow`` as a source code organizer for event/request handlers can use ``sloppy-queue-flow``.

``queue-flow`` as a data processor should not use ``sloppy-queue-flow``, unless you're *sure* it won't screw things up and you're *sure* the queueing is the bottleneck (if each step along the flow has a predictable processing time, ``sloppy-queue-flow`` will not provide any measureable advantage if the number of stages exceeds the number of processor cores).
